The flow of this program is the following:
Read the file into lines.
Put the content of the lines in an array of lines.
We have auxiliary functions to list all units and list all satellites.
Separate units by satellite.
The maximum number is the number of units in a satellite (we have to subtract one: the satellite name).


You may download or git clone the repository. 
Run `python solution.py input.txt` in the terminal and you should be able to view the output from the solution.py file. 
Run `python test.py` in order to run the automated tests to verify the helper functions pass.
